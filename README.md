# neovim-config

Place the shit in `~/.config/nvim/`

Might throw errors when starting the first time. If plugins not installing automatically, try run `:Lazy` and press `I` or `S`. If that doesn't work, who knows?

## Plugins to consider

- weilbith/nvim-code-action-menu
- karb94/neoscroll.nvim
- nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim 
- folke/todo-comments.nvim
