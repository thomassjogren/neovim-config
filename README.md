# neovim-config

Place the shit in `~/.config/nvim/`

Will throw a million errors when starting Neovim but should try installing all plugins automatically. If not, try run `:PackerInstall` and if that fails, look up installing Packer manually.

## Plugins to consider

- Enhanced code action menu (https://github.com/weilbith/nvim-code-action-menu)
- Smoot scrolling (https://github.com/karb94/neoscroll.nvim)
